## About The Project

[Troy Hunt's](https://www.troyhunt.com/) `';-- Have I Been Pwned` is an awesome project that lets you check if you have an account that has been compromised in a data breach.

As you can see on the [Consumers](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Consumers) page 
of [https://haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com), there are already Java clients available for the API.
Unfortunately some do not fully implement the API or have weird dependencies.

Here comes **haveibeenpwned4j** awesomeness:

* All features of `';-- Have I Been Pwned: API v3` implemented (incl. support for providing your API key) ✔ 
  * Check if a password has been breached	✔
  * Check if an account has been breached	✔
  * Check if an account has been in a paste	✔
  * Get all breaches (or based on a domain)	✔
  * Get a single breach	✔
* Apache License Version 2.0 ✔
* Available from Maven Central ✔


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install Java on your system. Java version 11 is the minimum required version

* Java: Ubuntu
```sh
sudo apt install default-jdk
```
* Java: Fedora
```sh
sudo dnf install java-11-openjdk
```
* Java: Windows
Install Java 11: E.g. [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot) or [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)


## Usage

1. Include the dependency in your pom.xml

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>de.martinspielmann.haveibeenpwned4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>haveibeenpwned4j</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Create a new `HaveIBeenPwnedApiClient` and start using it

```java
/**
 * <strong>Watch out:</strong> Authorization is required for all APIs that enable searching HIBP
 * by email address, namely getting breaches for an account, and getting pastes for and account. 
 * An API key is required to make an authorized call and can
 * be obtained on the API key page.
 * 
 * @see https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#Authorisation
 * @see https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key
 */
 
HaveIBeenPwnedApiClient client = new HaveIBeenPwnedApiClient("my-super-secret-api-key");

// find out if given password has been breached
boolean isPasswordPwned = client.isPasswordPwned("password123");

// get breaches for an account (needs API key)
List<Breach> breachesByAccount = client.getBreachesForAccount("foo.bar@example.com");

// get all breaches
List<Breach> allBreaches = client.getBreaches();

// find breach by name
Breach singleBreach = client.getSingleBreach("Example Breach");

// get pastes for an account (needs API key)
List<Paste> pastes = client.getPastesForAccount("foo.bar@example.com");
```
